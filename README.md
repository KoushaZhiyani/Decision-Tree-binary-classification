# Decision-Tree-binary-classification
<br>A decision tree is a decision support hierarchical model that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.<br><br>Numpy Pandas sklearn<br><br>
First, specify your database data X and y.
Use train_test_split to split your data into test and train.
Build the model and specify the data_train and target feature in the model.
If needed, you can also specify max_depht and min_n_sample.
Next, create an object from the accuracy_point class. In the predict method, send data_test.
and display the score using the accuracy attribute.
